React Individual Character Input Boxes (RICIBs) are individual inputs that are separate from each other but functionally act similar as a regular input box. Motivation came from Apples similar input boxes used for their two-factor authorization:

## Help, I cant get it to work or I want a feature!
Please feel free to submit an issue if you are running into trouble or have an idea for additional functionality!

## BUG
I am aware that there is a bug (mostly seems to occur in Chrome) where if you type to quickly sometimes the selection will spazz out and jump between inputs. I think it is a browser bug, but if anybody has any idea how to possibly fix this let me know please!
